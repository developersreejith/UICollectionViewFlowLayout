# UICollectionViewFlowLayout
This project consists of Working Sample Collection view implemented using UICollectionViewFlowLayout to implement a grid of images.

Usage
Once the app is launched, you will see a grid of cells in the collection view. Scroll to view more cells. Each cell displays a system image from the predefined imageNamesArray in the ViewController class.

You can customize the collection view layout by modifying the methods in the UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout extension in the ViewController class. The example code provided in the extension sets the cell size, spacing, and insets.

Feel free to experiment and modify the code to suit your needs!
